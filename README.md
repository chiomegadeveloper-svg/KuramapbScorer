# Kurama Pickleball Scorer

Full-screen pickleball scoreboard (PWA) for a smart TV or tablet, controlled from phones.
Developer: Kurama Information Technology Solutions · by CHI

## How it works
1. Open the site's domain on the TV/tablet → it shows a big QR code.
2. Scan with a phone → sign in with Google.
3. The scoreboard checks the account in Supabase:
   - active 24-hour pass, or at least 1 credit → starts a pass (uses 1 credit) and the phone becomes the remote
   - no credits → **Access denied** on the TV and the phone
4. Tap the team that **won the rally**; the app applies the rules.
5. When the pass ends, the board locks and asks for a new scan (another credit).

## Passes & payments
Support / developer contact: dinkykongsupport@gmail.com. Shown to players: payments support further development; approval takes 5 minutes to 2 hours.
Packages: PHP 50 / 24 h · PHP 150 / 3 days · PHP 300 / 1 week · PHP 800 / 1 month (table `packages`).
1. Player signs in with Google on the phone → no pass → **Buy a pass** → picks a package.
2. Pays with the InstaPay QR (`icons/instapay-qr.png`) from any bank / GCash / Maya.
3. Types the **last 6 digits** of the reference → request goes to the owner.
4. Owner opens `/owner/` (old `/admin.html` redirects there) → **Payments to check** → matches amount + last 6 digits → **Approve** (or Reject).
5. The phone unlocks by itself; time starts at the first scoreboard scan.
One account per purchase, one phone per account: the first phone used is locked to the account.
Owner can **reset the phone lock** in the Users table if a player changes phones.
